# Calorie Tracker

##Basic Overview

Calorie Tracker allows a user to quickly and easily track their caloric intake each day and track their progress over time.  The app is broken up into three sections:  Foods, Diary, and Calendar. (see images below).  Within the Foods section, a user can view all available foods in the system and update/delete a specific food.  Once the user has access to all of the foods they have eaten that day, they can hop over to the Diary section.  Within the Diary section, the user can add or select a Date they would like to track (the app does allow for back-dating).  Once the Date is selected, the user can select different foods and apply them to different meals throughout that specified Date.  As the user adds foods to a specific Meal, they can see the remaining calories left for that meal.  The user can also delete a food from a meal.  In the Calendar section, the user can view a historical record of their foods consumed based on meal and date.
